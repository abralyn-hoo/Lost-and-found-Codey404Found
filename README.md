# Lost & Found Web Application (Prototype)

## üîπ Track & Problem Statement
- **Track:** Software Track
- **Problem Statement:** Lost & Found System for University Campus

---

## üîπ Project Idea

Our system provides a **smart Lost & Found platform** powered by AI and Google Maps.  
It improves the process of reporting, identifying, and redeeming lost items by combining **AI-generated descriptions, image recognition, and secure redemption flow**.  

---

## üîπ Core Features

### 1. Item Upload & Recognition
- Students upload **at least 5 pictures** of their lost item.
- AI camera recognizes the object and compares it against the item library.
- AI generates item descriptions and characteristics automatically.
- Users can **review and edit the AI-generated description** before submitting.
- Additional details can be added (e.g., name on IC card).

### 2. Location Pinning
- Users mark where the item was last seen on **Google Maps**.
- A **location radius** is applied to improve search accuracy.
- If the user doesn‚Äôt know where they lost the item ‚Üí fallback to description search.

### 3. User Authentication
- Login with Google account required.
- Users must enter personal details (e.g., name, age, faculty).
- For searching, users can upload **similar pictures** found on the web.

### 4. Item Redemption
- Users schedule a time & location for physical redemption.
- After redemption:
  - Item is **not immediately deleted** from the library.
  - Redemption info is saved: who claimed, when, at which counter.
  - In case of fraud (false claim), a report can be filed to trace back.

### 5. Sensitive Items Handling
- For sensitive objects (e.g., Student ID, IC, bank card):
  - Only description is shown, **no images allowed**.
  - If users try to upload a sensitive-looking card, **AI will detect and prompt**:  
    *‚ÄúThis item may be sensitive, are you sure you want to proceed?‚Äù*

### 6. Additional Functions
- **Chatbox** (like Carousell):
  - Users must be verified (location pin + description matching) before chatting.
  - Option for direct physical meet-up to exchange items (instead of Lost & Found counter).

## üîπ Challenges Addressed
- **Uncertain Location:** If users don‚Äôt know where they lost it, description-based search is prioritized.  
- **Sensitive Items:** Protects privacy & security through AI filtering and restricted display.  
- **Fraud Prevention:** Redemption history is stored to trace misuse.
